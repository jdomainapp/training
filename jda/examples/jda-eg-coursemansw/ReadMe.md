# Standard CourseMan Software example 

## How to set up and run the CourseMan example
1. clone/pull latest version of the the training repository.
   - Suppose the cloned folder is: `~/jda-training/training`.
   - The folder that we focus on in this example:
      `EXAMPLE.FOLDER` = `~/jda-training/training/jda/examples/jda-eg-coursemanbasics`

2. compile the code (from the parent folder, to ensure that local-maven-repo is updated with any JDA's jar changes)
   1. cd into the parent folder: `.../examples`
3. compile source code: `mvn -U compile` (`-U` option is to activate the local-maven-repo updates)
